# Terminology {.smaller .with-bottom1}

::: incremental
-   **Gini Coefficient**<sup class="src">1</sup>

    -   Most widely used measure of income inequality\
    -   Range: 0 = perfect equality, 1 = extreme inequality\

-   **Before-tax Income**<sup class="src">1</sup>

    -   Income received before taxes or government transfers\
    -   Reflects market-based income distribution

-   **After-tax Income**<sup class="src">1</sup>

    -   Income after subtracting taxes and adding government transfers\
    -   Indicates resources actually available to households

# Summary

:::: incremental
::: smaller
*Social Inequality*

1.  **Global trend**
    -   Downward trend
    -   Consistently high level
2.  **Cross-country difference**
    -   Large difference across countries
3.  **Higher Gini linked to:**
    -   Lower happiness
    -   Higher homicide rate
    -   Lower life expectancy

:::
::::

# Limitations

::: incremental
-   **Data Quality**

    -   Data gaps\
    -   Subjective indicators bias

-   **Research Design**

    -   Single measure inequality indicator\
    -   Cross-sectional data
